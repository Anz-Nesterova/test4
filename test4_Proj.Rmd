```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
 ~install.packages("faraway") # If you don't have the package installed
library(faraway)
data("worldcup")
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
